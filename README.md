# Time-Series-Analysis
Platform Vulnerability Prediction using Time Series Analysis’ - is a project which will be predicting the similar types of vulnerabilities which had occurred in the past in an Operating System with the help of dataset of past vulnerabilities occurred in that Operating System. It will be using Time Series Analysis to predict the future vulnerability in the OS. The Prediction module will take a testing dataset out of the training dataset and will predict the vulnerabilities on it and it’ll be applied on the training dataset. The Prediction module will use three Time Series Analysis Methods – Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winter’s Seasonal Method and ARIMA to predict the vulnerabilities of the OS. It’ll display the vulnerabilities graph and will predict the future vulnerabilities through both the methods to compare the results. The Predicted vulnerabilities can help the OS users as well as OS designers to avoid or prevent vulnerabilities in the future.
